# tap_on_scroll Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `tap_on_scroll` package to solve the common issue of missed tap events while scrolling in Flutter applications.

## What This Example Shows

This demo application includes three examples:

1. **List Example**: Shows how to use `TapInterceptor` and `TappableArea` with a ListView to reliably handle tap events while scrolling.

2. **Grid Example**: Demonstrates the package working with a GridView, proving its versatility with different types of scrollable widgets.

3. **Pinned Header Example**: Showcases the most valuable use case - making pinned headers in CustomScrollView (SliverAppBar and SliverPersistentHeader) consistently tappable even during active scrolling.
   - **Crucial Implementation**: This example demonstrates how to make SliverAppBar **action buttons** remain tappable during scroll - a critical UI pattern in many apps that often fails without this package.

## Key Features Demonstrated

- Reliable tap detection even during active scrolling
- Visual feedback when items are tapped
- Usage with different types of scrollable widgets
- Making pinned headers tappable during scroll (critical use case)
- **AppBar action buttons that work reliably** - solving a common frustration in Flutter apps
- Simple integration with existing Flutter widgets

## How It Works

When you run this example, you can:

1. Scroll the list or grid rapidly
2. Tap on items while scrolling
3. Test the pinned header example by scrolling and tapping on the persistent headers
4. **Try tapping the action buttons in the SliverAppBar while scrolling** - notice they respond reliably
5. Notice how the tap events are correctly captured and the UI updates accordingly

This demonstrates the core functionality of the `tap_on_scroll` package: making scrollable widgets more responsive to user interaction, with special attention to the often problematic pinned headers.

## Implementation Details

The example shows:

- How to wrap your scrollable widgets with the `TapInterceptor` widget
- How to wrap your tappable items with the `TappableArea` widget
- How to properly implement tappable pinned headers in a CustomScrollView
- **How to ensure AppBar actions remain responsive during scroll momentum**

The pinned header example is particularly important as it addresses a common challenge in Flutter apps where pinned headers often become unresponsive during scrolling.
